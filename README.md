# CNN News Dashboard

CNN News Dashboard is a Python project that provides a dashboard interface for exploring the # CNN-DailyMail News Text Summarization dataset. This dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze various aspects of the news articles in an interactive manner.

## Dataset

The CNN-DailyMail news text summarization dataset used in this project is sourced from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail). It contains a collection of news articles from CNN and DailyMail, along with corresponding article summaries. The dataset provides an excellent resource for text summarization research and analysis.

Please note that some preprocessing has been applied to the dataset as part of the accompanying [CNN-text](https://github.com/rombeii/CNN-text) project.
